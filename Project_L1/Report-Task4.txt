1. what  is the difference between true state and observation?
True state represents the exact, real value of the system, following the system model: x(i+1) = x(i) + 1. It contains no noise or measurement error.
The observation is the measured value: y(i) = x(i) + noise. The difference between them is the measurement error.

2. How does estimation reduce noise?
The moving average reduces noise by averaging several measurements.
Since the noise has zero mean, positive and negative fluctuations cancel out.
Larger window -> smoother estimate.

3. How does changing the noise level affect estimation?
Higher noise -> observations are more scattered -> estimation becomes less accurate.
More noise requires a larger window to smooth it.

4. How does the window size affect the result?
Small window -> fast response, but noisier estimate.
Large window -> smoother estimate, but introduces delay (lag).
